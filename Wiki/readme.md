# GX-Jailbreak

Welcome to the GX-Jailbreak wiki! This guide provides all the necessary information to use and understand our jailbreak tool.

## Introduction

GX-Jailbreak is a jailbreak tool for iOS/iPadOS 1.0 - 11.4.1. It allows you to unlock additional features on your Apple device by bypassing the operating system's restrictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the jailbreak, make sure you have:

- A compatible iOS/iPadOS device (version 1.0 - 11.4.1)
- A stable internet connection

### Jailbreak Type

- **Rootless**: This type of jailbreak does not modify the root filesystem. It's safer and easier to revert.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Jailbreak**:
   - Open the GX-Jailbreak app on your device.
   - Click on the "Jailbreak" button to begin the process.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the process to complete.

2. **Reboot Your Device**:
   - After the jailbreak process, click the "Reboot" button.
   - The device will count down from 10 seconds before rebooting.
   - During the reboot, several steps will be displayed on the screen, indicating the progress.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the jailbreak process, consider the following steps:

- **Ensure Compatibility**: Verify that your device and iOS/iPadOS version are supported.
- **Stable Internet Connection**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
